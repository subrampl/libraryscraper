SATURDAY, MAY 20

SF Shakes’ Bay Area Shakespeare Camps teaching artists will be hosting a free workshop for children ages 8-13.

We’ll play games, act out famous moments, and savor the deliciousness of Shakespeare’s wonderful language! During the last 20 minutes of the program, parents will get to enjoy a mini-presentation of the fun we’ve been having! Pre-registration is required. 
Children must sign up in person at the Children’s Desk in the Cupertino Library.
